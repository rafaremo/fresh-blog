After more than 10 years of being into web development I finally decided to start documenting my journey. The plan was simple, let's see what new tech I want to try out and build a simple blog in one evening.

With so many new stacks ready to try out the decision was not as simple as expected, my links site has been done with Astro, my day to day job let me play with Shopifyâ€™s Hydrogen, Gatsby and Next. Just some weeks ago a new framework called Fresh was announced by the Deno team, it sounded amazing with the same island approach as Astro, no unnecessary client Javascript shipped to the browser, server rendered and it let me try the new Deno Deploy platform by deploying this new blog there.

This blog post is intended to document the process I followed to build this new blog. I hope to create a new entry at least once a week and help other developers in the process.
